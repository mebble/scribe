Some useful scripts

## Deno

Deno scripts require:

- `deno.json` to ensure the Deno LSP is used instead of tsserver in neovim
- `.vscode/settings.json` to be used in vscode

See the [deno editor docs](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/getting_started/setup_your_environment/) for details


## Python

Python scripts are to be run with `python3`
